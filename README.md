# TODO
Things that must be done to complete the project.

**Home Page:** Page that provides clear navigation to the core features of the site.

**News:** Page that lists all current MEGA News Article titles and a short snippit of the article within.

**WIKI:** Implement a Wiki system that will allow certain members rights to edit the content and be easily searchable. *There are open source systems we can use to implement this.*

**Forums:** Implement a Forum system that will allow proper communication for members while making certain sections readable by the public. *There are open source systems we can use to implement this.*

**Arcade:** A section of the website that allows people to play select games made by DAGD students. This will involve a database and will likely need to be updated manually to add more games.

**Account System:** We will need a database to store accounts. These accounts will grant permissions to users for the forums and wiki.
